# parsing LOB

Scripts that prepare corpora in the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen (LOB) series for parsing using the Stanford Parser. This series includes POS-tagged versions of LOB, Freiburg-LOB, and CLOB. This is intended to be useful as a parsed historical corpus in the vein of the Penn Parsed Corpus of Historical English.

In particular, these scripts convert the hand annotated POS tagged versions of the LOB series with equivalent POS tags used by the default parsing model included with the Stanford Parser.
